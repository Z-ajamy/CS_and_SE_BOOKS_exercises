# Data Structures

## Overview
This learning track is designed for students and professionals who want to develop a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms using C++. The track is based on two authoritative books:

1. **Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ (Second Edition)** by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and David M. Mount.
2. **Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++** by Mark Allen Weiss.

These books provide comprehensive coverage of fundamental and advanced concepts, equipping learners with the theoretical understanding and practical skills needed for efficient problem-solving and software development.

## Learning Objectives
By following this track, you will:
- Gain a deep understanding of data structures and their implementations in C++.
- Learn algorithm design techniques and performance analysis.
- Develop problem-solving skills necessary for competitive programming and technical interviews.
- Implement and analyze various searching, sorting, and graph algorithms.
- Optimize code efficiency using best practices in C++.

## Prerequisites
To make the most of this track, learners should have:
- Basic proficiency in C++.
- Understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
- Familiarity with mathematical concepts such as logarithms, recursion, and asymptotic analysis.

## Curriculum Outline

### **Phase 1: Foundations of Data Structures**
- Introduction to Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Arrays, Vectors, and Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

### **Phase 2: Trees and Graphs**
- Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
- Balanced Trees (AVL, Red-Black Trees, B-Trees)
- Heaps and Priority Queues
- Graph Representations (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- Graph Traversal Algorithms (DFS, BFS)

### **Phase 3: Algorithm Design and Analysis**
- Asymptotic Notation (Big-O, Omega, Theta)
- Recursion and Divide & Conquer
- Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort)

- Work on small projects that utilize data structures and algorithms for real-world applications.

## Additional Resources
- Online courses (Coursera, Udemy, edX) related to data structures and algorithms.
- Competitive programming challenges to enhance problem-solving skills.
- Open-source C++ repositories for reference and further learning.

## Conclusion
Mastering data structures and algorithms in C++ is a crucial step for software engineers, competitive programmers, and computer science students. This track, based on two highly respected books, provides a structured path for learning, practice, and mastery. By following the curriculum and applying the knowledge in coding challenges and projects, learners will be well-prepared for interviews and real-world problem-solving.

Happy Learning!
