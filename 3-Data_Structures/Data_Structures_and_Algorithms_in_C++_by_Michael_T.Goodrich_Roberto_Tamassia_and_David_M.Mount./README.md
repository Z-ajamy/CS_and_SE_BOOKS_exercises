- The Standard Template Library (STL)
- Program and File Organization
- Writing a C++ Program

### 2. Object-Oriented Design
- Goals, Principles, and Patterns
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Templates
- Exception Handling

### 3. Arrays, Linked Lists, and Recursion
- Arrays (One-Dimensional and Two-Dimensional)
- Singly and Doubly Linked Lists
- Circular Linked Lists and List Reversal
- Recursion (Linear, Binary, and Multiple Recursion)

### 4. Analysis Tools
- Growth Rate Functions (Constant, Logarithmic, Linear, etc.)
- Algorithm Analysis (Experimental Studies, Asymptotic Notation, etc.)
- Justification Techniques (Induction, Loop Invariants)

### 5. Stacks, Queues, and Deques
