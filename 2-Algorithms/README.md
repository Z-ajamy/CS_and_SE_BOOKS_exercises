## Study Plan
1. Start with *Grokking Algorithms* for an intuitive introduction.
2. Move to *Algorithms Unplugged* for deeper insights.
3. Study *Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)* for theoretical foundations.
4. Explore *The Algorithm Design Manual* for practical algorithm design techniques.
5. Use *Algorithms in C* and *Algorithms in C++* to practice implementation.
6. Learn graph algorithms from *Algorithms in C++ Part 5*.
7. Use *Algorithms Notes for Professionals* as a supplementary reference.

## Goals
- Gain a strong theoretical and practical understanding of algorithms.
- Improve problem-solving skills and efficiency in coding.
- Prepare for coding interviews and algorithmic challenges.
