# Chapter 3: Structured Program Development in C  
**From the book: C How to Program**

## Objectives  
In this chapter, youâ€™ll:  
- Use basic problem-solving techniques.  
- Develop algorithms through the process of top-down, stepwise refinement.  
- Select actions to execute based on a condition using the `if` and `if...else` selection statements.  
- Execute statements in a program repeatedly using the `while` iteration statement.  
- Use counter-controlled iteration and sentinel-controlled iteration.  
- Use structured programming techniques.  
- Use increment, decrement, and assignment operators.  
- Continue our presentation of Secure C programming.

## Section Summaries  

### 3.1 Introduction  
Before writing a program to solve a problem, you must have a thorough understanding of the problem and a carefully planned solution approach. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss developing structured computer programs. In Section 4.11, structured programming techniques are summarized.

### 3.2 Algorithms  
The solution to any computing problem involves executing a series of actions in a specific order.  

An **algorithm** is a procedure for solving a problem, defined by:  
1. The actions to execute.  
2. The order in which these actions should execute.  

#### Example: "Rise-and-Shine Algorithm"  
1. Get out of bed.  
2. Take off pajamas.  
3. Take a shower.  
4. Get dressed.  
5. Eat breakfast.  
6. Carpool to work.  

Executing these steps in order ensures effective preparation for the day. Altering the order can result in undesired outcomes.
