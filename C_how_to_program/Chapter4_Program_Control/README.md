# Chapter 4: Program Control

This chapter explores the fundamental concepts of program control in C programming. It introduces different control structures, iteration mechanisms, and programming best practices. Below is an outline of the chapter's contents:

## 4.1 Introduction
- Discusses the importance of program control.
- Overview of control structures: sequential, selection, and iteration.

## 4.2 Iteration Essentials
- Introduction to loops and repetitive tasks in programming.
- Explanation of iteration structures and their purpose.

## 4.3 Counter-Controlled Iteration
- Definition and characteristics of counter-controlled loops.
- Key components: loop control variable, initial value, increment/decrement, and loop continuation condition.

## 4.4 `for` Iteration Statement
- Syntax and functionality of the `for` loop.
- Comparison with other iteration statements.

## 4.5 Examples Using the `for` Statement
- Practical examples of `for` loops in different scenarios.
- Patterns such as nested loops and summing series.

## 4.6 `switch` Multiple-Selection Statement
- Syntax and use cases of the `switch` statement.
- Difference between `switch` and `if-else` constructs.

## 4.7 `doâ€¦while` Iteration Statement
- Syntax and functionality of the `do...while` loop.
- Differences compared to `while` and `for` loops.

## 4.8 `break` and `continue` Statements
- Role of `break` in terminating loops or `switch` cases.
- Use of `continue` to skip the remainder of a loop's body.

## 4.9 Logical Operators
- Explanation of logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
- Use cases in decision-making and iteration.

## 4.10 Confusing Equality (`==`) and Assignment (`=`) Operators
- Common mistakes involving `==` and `=`.
- Best practices to avoid logical errors.

## 4.11 Structured-Programming Summary
- Recap of structured programming principles.
- Importance of clear and maintainable code.

## 4.12 Secure C Programming
- Tips for writing secure and robust C programs.
- Identifying and avoiding vulnerabilities in program control.
