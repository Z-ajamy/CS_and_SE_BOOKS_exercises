# Chapter 1: Introduction to Computers, the Internet and the World Wide Web

## 1.1 Introduction
This section provides an overview of computers, how they have evolved, and their significance in modern life. It introduces the foundational concepts of computing, including hardware, software, and their interaction.

---

## 1.2 Computers: Hardware and Software
- **Hardware** refers to the physical components of a computer system (e.g., CPU, memory, storage devices, input/output devices).
- **Software** includes the programs and data that tell the hardware how to perform specific tasks.
- The interplay between hardware and software forms the backbone of computing.

---

## 1.3 Computer Organization
- Discusses how data and instructions are processed and stored within a computer.
- Focuses on the internal structure of computers, including CPU operations, memory hierarchy, and I/O systems.
- Examines the role of machine cycles, registers, and the fetch-execute cycle.

---

## 1.4 Personal, Distributed, and Client/Server Computing
- **Personal Computing**: Single-user systems that offer autonomy to the user.
- **Distributed Computing**: Systems where resources are shared across multiple systems.
- **Client/Server Computing**: The client requests services from a server, which processes and returns results.

---

## 1.5 The Internet and the World Wide Web
- The **Internet** is a global network of interconnected computers.
- The **World Wide Web** (WWW) is an information system that uses the Internet to deliver content.
- Protocols like HTTP/HTTPS facilitate communication on the web.

---

## 1.6 Web 2.0
- Refers to the second generation of web-based services that emphasize user interaction, sharing, and collaboration.
- Examples include social media platforms, wikis, and content-sharing services.

---

## 1.7 Machine Languages, Assembly Languages and High-Level Languages
- **Machine Languages**: The lowest level, consisting of binary code executed directly by the hardware.
- **Assembly Languages**: A higher-level abstraction using mnemonic codes for instructions.
- **High-Level Languages**: Easier to read and write, closer to human language (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python).

---

## 1.8 History of C and C++
- **C**: Developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.
- **C++**: An extension of C, designed to support object-oriented programming by Bjarne Stroustrup.
- C++ is widely used in system programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.

---

## 1.9 C++ Standard Library
- A set of pre-defined classes and functions in C++ that facilitate common programming tasks.
- Includes features such as containers (like `std::vector`), algorithms, input/output, and utilities.

---

## 1.10 History of Java
- **Java** was developed in the mid-1990s by Sun Microsystems.
- Aimed to provide "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) capability, emphasizing platform independence.

---

## 1.11 Fortran, COBOL, Pascal and Ada
- **Fortran**: Used extensively for scientific and engineering computations.
- **COBOL**: Primarily used for business applications.
- **Pascal**: A structured, imperative programming language.
- **Ada**: Used in real-time and safety-critical applications.

---

## 1.12 BASIC, Visual Basic, Visual C++, C# and .NET
- **BASIC**: Beginnerâ€™s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, designed for teaching.
- **Visual Basic (VB)**: Event-driven programming for Windows applications.
- **C# and .NET**: Developed by Microsoft, designed for Windows application development and web-based applications.

---

## 1.13 Key Software Trend: Object Technology
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** focuses on designing software using objects and classes.
- Benefits include modularity, reusability, and improved maintainability.

---

## 1.14 Typical C++ Development Environment
- Includes tools such as compilers (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio), Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), debuggers, and text editors.
- Setting up a development environment ensures efficient coding and debugging.

---

## 1.15 Notes About C++ and C++ How to Program, 7/e
- "C++ How to Program" by Deitel & Deitel serves as a comprehensive guide to C++ programming.
- It provides detailed examples, exercises, and real-world case studies.

---

## 1.16 Test-Driving a C++ Application
- **Test-Driving** refers to writing tests before coding to ensure the software meets requirements.
- It improves code quality and ensures functionality.

---

## 1.17 Software Technologies
- Modern software development involves a range of technologies including version control systems, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and automated testing tools.

---

## 1.18 Future of C++: Open Source Boost Libraries, TR1 and C++0x
- **Boost Libraries**: A collection of C++ libraries that extend the Standard Library.
- **TR1**: Technical Report 1 that introduced several C++ features.
- **C++0x**: A series of extensions like lambda expressions and smart pointers that modernized C++.

---

## 1.19 Software Engineering Case Study: Introduction to Object Technology and the UML
- **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** is used for designing object-oriented software systems.
- Emphasizes planning, documenting, and visualizing system architecture and behavior.

---

## 1.20 Wrap-Up
- Recap of key points from Chapter 1, emphasizing the evolution of computing, the development of programming languages, and the rise of object-oriented programming.

---

## 1.21 Web Resources
- Lists useful websites and tools for further exploration of C++, programming, and software development.
