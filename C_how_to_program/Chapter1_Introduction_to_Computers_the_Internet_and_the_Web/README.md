## 1.6 Machine Languages, Assembly Languages, and High-Level Languages
Computing languages have evolved from machine-level code to more abstract programming languages.

### Machine Languages:
- **Definition**: The lowest level of programming, consisting of binary code (0s and 1s).
- **Characteristics**: Specific to hardware, highly efficient but difficult to read and write.

### Assembly Languages:
- **Definition**: A symbolic representation of machine languages, using mnemonics for instructions.
- **Example**: Using `MOV`, `ADD`, etc., instead of binary instructions.
  
### High-Level Languages:
- **Definition**: Languages that are more abstract, closer to human languages.
- **Examples**: C, C++, Python, Java.
- **Advantages**: Easier to read, write, and maintain code.
- **Compiler/Interpreter**: Translates high-level code into machine language.
