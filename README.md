## DOD
It is also important to tell you about my own definition of done *DOD* that I will follow.

    1. Search for the best books and other resources on the topic under study.
    2. Read and follow every piece of information as much as possible to reach the deepest point that can be reached and benefited from.
    3. Summarizing it in my paper summaries in a non-derogatory summary.
    4. Understand how it affects the higher levels *if I am studying at a low level*, or understand how it affects the lower levels *if I am studying at a high level*.
    5. Solve the book exercises
    6. Solving problems related to the subject under study will most likely depend on leetcode.
    7. Practical application on a large project that includes previous concepts as a kind of review on them and the concepts that you have just completed.
    8. Teasting & Teasting
    9. Feynman Technique test for understanding and the ability to explain information without complexity and without resorting to any source other than ideas (neither Google nor ChatGPT)
