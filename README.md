### Hi again, it's me Abd al-rahman Al-ajamy

This is my **HARD ROADMAP**, which is based on books and focuses on delving into each topic as deeply as possible[^1].

## Definition of Done *(DOD)*

**It is also important to tell you about my own definition of done *DOD* that I will follow.**

0. **Search for resources**: Look for the best books and other reliable resources on the topic under study.  
1. **Deep reading**: Study and follow every detail as much as possible to reach the deepest point of understanding and application.  
2. **Summarization**: Write comprehensive yet concise paper summaries that cover all key points without omitting essential details.  
3. **Relational understanding**:  
   - Understand how the topic influences higher levels if I am studying at a low level.  
   - Understand its foundational role if I am studying at a high level.  
4. **Exercise practice**: Solve all exercises provided in the books or other resources.  
5. **Problem-solving**: Practice problems related to the subject, primarily using platforms like [LeetCode][leetcode].  
6. **Project application**: Develop a large, practical project that integrates previously studied concepts as a review and applies newly learned ideas.  
7. **Testing & Iteration**: Conduct thorough testing, iterating until the solution or project is robust.  
8. **Feynman Technique**: Test my understanding by explaining the topic clearly without using any external aids (neither Google nor ChatGPT).  
9. **Community engagement**: Share knowledge and progress with the technical community using platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, Medium, or Stack Overflow.
