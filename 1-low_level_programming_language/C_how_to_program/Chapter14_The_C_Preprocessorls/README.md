# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 14: The C Preprocessor  

## ðŸ“– Overview  
The **C preprocessor** is a powerful tool that processes source code **before** actual compilation. It enhances the flexibility and efficiency of C programs by allowing **code inclusion**, **macro definitions**, **conditional compilation**, and **preprocessor-specific directives**.  

Preprocessor directives begin with the `#` symbol and execute before compilation starts. Unlike C statements, these directives do not end with a semicolon (`;`). Understanding the preprocessor is essential for writing **portable**, **efficient**, and **maintainable** C programs.

## ðŸš€ Learning Objectives  
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:  
âœ” Understand the role of the **C preprocessor** in compilation.  
âœ” Use **#include** to incorporate external files into your program.  
âœ” Define and use **symbolic constants** and **macros** effectively.  
âœ” Implement **conditional compilation** to selectively enable/disable code sections.  
âœ” Utilize **error handling directives** to manage code execution during compilation.  
âœ” Apply best practices for **secure and optimized C programming**.

## ðŸ›  Key Features of the C Preprocessor  

### ðŸ”¹ `#include` â€“ File Inclusion  
The `#include` directive allows you to **import** standard or user-defined header files into your program. This prevents redundant code and promotes modularity.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example: Including Standard and User-Defined Headers**  
```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Standard library header
#include "myheader.h"  // User-defined header
