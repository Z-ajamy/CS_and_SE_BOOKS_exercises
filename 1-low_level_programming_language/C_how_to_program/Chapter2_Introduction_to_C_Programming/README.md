## 2.1 Introduction
- Overview of the C programming language and its historical significance.
- Importance of learning structured programming concepts.
- Introduction to how C is a foundation for many modern languages.

---

## 2.2 A Simple C Program: Printing a Line of Text
- Example of a basic C program that prints a line of text using `printf`.
- Explanation of each part of the program, including:
  - Preprocessor directives (`#include`).
  - The `main` function as the program's entry point.
  - Use of the semicolon to terminate statements.
  - Displaying output to the console.

---

## 2.3 Another Simple C Program: Adding Two Integers
- Example of a program that reads two integers from the user and prints their sum.
- Key concepts:
  - Declaring variables (`int` data type).
  - Using `scanf` for input and `printf` for output.
  - Understanding format specifiers (e.g., `%d` for integers).

---

## 2.4 Memory Concepts
- Explanation of how variables are stored in memory.
- Key terms:
  - **Memory Address**: Location of a variable in memory.
  - **Value**: Data stored in the variable.
- Concept of memory allocation for variables.

---

## 2.5 Arithmetic in C
- Performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
- Operator precedence and associativity rules in C.
- Examples of expressions and their evaluations.

---

## 2.6 Decision Making: Equality and Relational Operators
- Introduction to conditional logic in C.
- Relational operators:
  - Equality (`==`) and inequality (`!=`).
  - Greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), and less than or equal to (`<=`).
- Example of decision-making using `if` statements to perform actions based on conditions.
