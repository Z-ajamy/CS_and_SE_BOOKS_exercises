# Chapter 11: File Processing

## 11.1 Introduction
In Chapter 1, we studied the data hierarchy. Data stored in variables is temporary and is lost when a program terminates. Files allow long-term data retention by storing data on secondary storage devices such as solid-state drives, flash drives, and hard drives. This chapter explains how to create, update, and process data files. We explore both sequential-access and random-access file processing.

## 11.2 Files and Streams
C views each file as a sequential stream of bytes. Every file ends with an end-of-file marker or a specific byte number recorded in a system-maintained administrative structure. This behavior is platform-dependent and hidden from the programmer.

### Standard Streams in Every Program
When a file is opened, C associates a stream with it. At the start of program execution, C automatically opens three standard streams:
- **Standard input stream (stdin):** Receives input from the keyboard.
- **Standard output stream (stdout):** Displays output on the screen.
- **Standard error stream (stderr):** Displays error messages on the screen.

## 11.3 Creating a Sequential-Access File
- **11.3.1 Pointer to a FILE**: Managing file pointers using `FILE *`.
- **11.3.2 Using `fopen` to Open a File**: Opening files in various modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, etc.).
- **11.3.3 Using `feof` to Check for End-of-File Indicator**: Detecting the end of file during reading.
- **11.3.4 Using `fprintf` to Write to a File**: Formatting and writing data to files.
- **11.3.5 Using `fclose` to Close a File**: Properly closing files to release resources.
- **11.3.6 File-Open Modes**: Understanding different file open modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, `rb`, `wb`, etc.).

## 11.4 Reading Data from a Sequential-Access File
- **11.4.1 Resetting the File Position Pointer**: Managing file position pointers for re-reading data.
- **11.4.2 Credit Inquiry Program**: Implementing a real-world example of sequential file processing.

## 11.5 Random-Access Files
Random-access files allow data to be read and written at any location without reading the entire file sequentially.

## 11.6 Creating a Random-Access File
Exploring the process of creating a file with random-access capability.

## 11.7 Writing Data Randomly to a Random-Access File
- **11.7.1 Positioning the File Position Pointer with `fseek`**: Moving the file pointer to specific locations.
- **11.7.2 Error Checking**: Handling errors during file operations.

## 11.8 Reading Data from a Random-Access File
Understanding techniques for reading specific parts of a random-access file.

## 11.9 Case Study: Transaction-Processing System
A detailed example of a transaction-processing system that manages financial transactions efficiently.

## 11.10 Secure C Programming
Best practices for secure file handling, preventing data corruption, and ensuring file integrity.
