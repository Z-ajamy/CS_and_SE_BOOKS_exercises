## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to helping students and software engineers master low-level programming concepts in C, C++, and OOP in C++. The notes cover essential topics for building a strong foundation in systems programming.

## C Programming

### Memory Management
In C, memory is managed manually. This section includes:
- Using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, and `free()` for dynamic memory allocation.
- Understanding stack vs heap memory.
- Handling memory leaks and dangling pointers.

### Pointers and Arrays
Pointers are a key concept in C. This section covers:
- Pointer declaration and dereferencing.
- Array-pointer relationship.
- Pointer arithmetic.

### Structures and Unions
Structures and unions allow grouping different data types. This section covers:
- Defining and using structs.
- Differences between structures and unions.
- Memory layout and alignment issues.

## C++ Programming

### Basic Syntax
C++ builds on C, adding support for object-oriented programming. Topics include:
- Variable declaration and data types.
- Control structures (loops, conditionals).
- Functions and parameter passing.

### Classes and Objects
C++ supports classes, which allow for abstraction and data encapsulation. This section covers:
- Defining classes and constructors.
- Member functions and access specifiers.
- Static members and destructors.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism
Inheritance and polymorphism are key features of OOP in C++. This section covers:
- Base and derived classes.
- Virtual functions and function overriding.
- Dynamic binding.

### Operator Overloading
C++ allows overloading operators to create more intuitive code. Topics covered:
- Overloading arithmetic and comparison operators.
- Operator overloading for classes.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only necessary parts. This section covers:
- Access specifiers: `private`, `protected`, `public`.
- Using getter and setter functions.

### Abstraction
Abstraction allows simplifying complex systems. This section covers:
- Abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
- Interfaces in C++.

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. Topics covered:
- Single and multiple inheritance.
- Overriding inherited functions.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability to treat objects of different types as instances of the same type. This section covers:
- Runtime polymorphism using virtual functions.
- Compile-time polymorphism using function overloading.

## Conclusion
These notes aim to provide a solid understanding of low-level programming techniques in C, C++, and Object-Oriented Programming. Mastering these concepts is essential for becoming proficient in systems programming and for pursuing a career in software development.
